The idea is to split the information of an optical signal using an “acousto-optic modulator” (synapse) into multiple signals. The signals are then communicated through multiple parallel channels similar to neurons and recombined at the receiver end by using another acousto-optic modulator. Such neuro-synaptic networks are targeted for less than 100 mW power budget and greater than 100 GHz communication bandwidths which are currently hindered by the performance of the piezoelectric transducer used in the acousto-optic modulators. It generates high-frequency acoustic waves inside the attached waveguide which act as dynamic optical gratings offering periodic modification of the refractive index of the medium through which the light is traveling. To solve this issue, the applicant proposes exploring optically birefringent ferroelectrics with strong elasto-optic coefficients as stand-alone acousto-optic modulators. The project aims for the development of a CMOS compatible 100 GHz-THz range ferroelectric acousto-optic modulator (FAOM) and its integration in a self-learning neuro-synaptic network. The applicant will unite his expertise in materials engineering and photo-ferroelectrics with Katholieke Universiteit Leuven’s (KUL) and IBM’s knowledge of the integration and characterization of neuromorphic networks with the following objectives: 1. Growth of CMOS compatible strain-engineered BaTiO3 (BTO) heterostructures.2.

For example energy vendor may be interested to limit some non-critical energy-consuming assets at the peak time (like air conditioning when nobody is at home) or maximize home-based PV installation capacity of its customer at the peak time. Thanks to that, the vendor is able to buy less energy in the wholesale market at the peak times. Yielding control over some consuming/producing assets brings value to vendors final customers - they will be able to pay less for the energy (less consumption in peak times) and/or get better price for the green energy they produce at home and they will not need to pay any attention in order to achieve that.

The platform can be a valuable tool in quickly controlling the spread of new virus strainsamong populations. The timing of RAPID closely corresponds with a current focus of the vaccine industry on novel vaccineplatform technologies that enable rapid response to emerging threats.The BunyaVax RNA particle technology combines the efficacy of live vaccines with the safety of inactivated or subunitvaccines – which are currently the standard vaccine technologies. A unique characteristic of the RNA platform is that itallows for ‘plug and play’ application. Any gene can be plugged into the RNA particle genome to generate inherently safeand efficacious vaccines. The platform can stably express a broad variety of pathogen derived antigens. A major advantageis that development and manufacturing can be completed in a timeframe of 16 weeks which is at least twice as fast ascurrent methods. The BunyaVax technology is in a stage of proven efficacy in sheep.RAPID is designed to prepare for partnerships with vaccine manufacturers and/or venture capital firms and to lay thefoundation for clinical application of the vaccine platform. Key steps for upscaled production levels will be taken. The innovation project is at the core of the strategy of BunyaVax. The project is instrumental for reaching a stage in which commercial partnerships can be explored. Ultimately, this will allow BunyaVax to forward the technology to a stage in which industry can use it to develop vaccines for controlling veterinary and human infectious disease outbreaks at an earlier stage than currently possible.","2022-08-10 13:02:00","217731","10.3030/815645"

Important problems to be solved on the way to the applications of SMMs in molecular spintronics is their deposition on surfaces and addressing their spins on the single molecular level. In this project we will address these problems by designing SMMs based on endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) derivatized with anchoring groups. SMM behaviour recently discovered for DySc2N@C80 and Dy2ScN@C80 in PI’s group is governed by a strong magnetic anisotropy (magnetic moments of Dy ions are aligned along the Dy–N bonds) and ferromagnetic exchange interactions between Dy ions within the clusters. Protected by the carbon cages, these SMMs exhibit uniquely long zero-field relaxation times of several hours at 2 K and provide an ideal system for addressing the individual spin states. Spatial orientation of magnetic moments in EMF-SMMs is determined by the endohedral cluster and is therefore influenced by the orientation of the EMFs molecules and their internal dynamics. We will apply three strategies to control the spatial arrangement of the magnetic moments in EMF-SMMs: (i) deposition of EMF molecules via sublimation; (ii) exohedral modification of EMFs with anchoring groups for grafting of EMFs on surfaces; (iii) introducing photoswitchable units into the anchoring groups which can reversibly change their geometry upon impact of light and will allow switching direction of the magnetic moment in a fully controllable way. Magnetic behaviour of the surface-grafted SMMs will be studied by bulk- and surface-sensitive techniques including X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and especially spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Successful fulfillment of the objectives of this interdisciplinary high-risk/high-gain project will revolutionize the field of the surface molecular magnetism by allowing the study and control of the SMMs on a single spin level.","2022-08-18 08:50:00","194532","10.3030/648295"

They are essential to understand how tissues such as intestine and liver take up and degrade pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the lack of suitable in vitro systems, these assays are carried out in experimental animals. This practice increases cost and development time but also creates significant ethical issues. We recently developed a 3D culture system that allows us to expand human tissue stem cells from intestine and liver as organoids and differentiate them to the respective functional adult tissue in vitro. These stem cell-derived tissues show high cytochrome activity and are able to metabolize drugs in a simple and cost-effective in vitro assay. With support from the ERC Proof of concept grant we aim to prove that our technology can outperform current in vitro systems and replace a significant portion of animal-based toxicology studies. This technological advance will lead to substantial reduction of cost in industrial and academic drug development and overcome practical and ethical pitfalls in animal-based testing.To this end we will develop an organoid-based assay to test tissue-drug interactions in three steps:1) Definition of optimal parameters for human in vitro assays to assess gastro-intestinal and hepatic toxicity 2) Scale-up3) Technology transfer and commercial distribution","2022-08-09 18:23:00","209165","10.3030/737600"

The experimental platform is a two-dimensional crystal of laser-cooled ions held in a radio-frequency trap. In this approach, the quantum state of a spin is encoded in two electronic levels of an ion. Effective spin-spin interactions are induced by laser fields coupling the ions’ electronic levels to excitations of the crystal lattice. Single-particle quantum control will be achieved by manipulating individual ions with a strongly focused steerable laser beam. Single-shot quantum measurements with near-unit detection efficiency will enable measurements of arbitrary spin correlation functions.The main goals of SPICY are:1. Trapping and laser-cooling of two-dimensional ion crystals to millikelvin temperatures in a radio-frequency trap. 2. Realization of quantum spin models with particle numbers for which the simulation becomes intractable by numerical techniques.3. Development of methods for validating quantum simulators 4.

This novel and versatile methodology has been used to measure exotic nuclei down to rates of less than 20 atoms/second. In order to achieve these results the CRIS method has had to efficiently remove interference isotopes that would otherwise saturate the detectors. The key advantages of the method are its high selectivity, interference suppression and compact size. In principle it can be combined with mass spectrometry techniques such as ICP-MS and IRMS to enhance their respective sensitivity by more than three orders of magnitude in a compact table top device. This would have applications in the industries that utilize radioisotope detection for molecular labelling and dating.  We believe that our methodology has the potential to significantly reduce the costs associated detecting isotopes such as 14C.

One of the main goals of a HIV-1 vaccine is the generation of cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses that counteract the virus. CD8 T cells participate in the control of viremia early but progressively show weakened functions, which leads to loss of virus control. HIV controllers are a rare group of infected patients who can control the virus for years without antiretroviral therapy. CD8 T cells from HIV-controllers display an outstanding capacity to eliminate infected CD4 T cells ex vivo but the underlying mechanisms are still not understood.Preliminary data aiming at establishing a single cell transcriptional signature associated with control of HIV suggest an important role of the mTOR pathway during the chronic stage. This pathway plays a major role in glucose metabolism and CD8 T cells cytotoxic function. This raises the hypothesis that the extraordinary HIV-suppressive capacity of HIV-controllers CD8 T cells is associated with the modulation of mTOR pathway and glucose metabolism.This project aims to 1) Study the single cell gene expression of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in HIV patients longitudinally from acute to chronic stages and understand the factors linked to control and loss of function of CD8 T cells during disease progression. 2) To characterize the role of mTOR pathway in the ability of CD8 T cells from HIV-controller to eliminate infected cells and test if this pathway can be modulated to fine-tune anti-HIV CD8 T cells responses. 3) To understand if an optimal glucose metabolism is necessary for CD8 T-cells suppression of HIV and if this capacity can be improved by increasing available glucose. This work will help to understand the characteristics of effective CD8+ T cell responses against HIV and may guide the development of anti-HIV vaccines or immunotherapies to induce HIV controller-like responses in HIV-infected progressors.","2022-08-09 08:49:00","201464","10.3030/706871"

This is achieved by showing that chain-level string topological structures are induced by a homotopy Frobenius structure on the cochain algebra and by connecting the homotopy Frobenius structure with known invariants from quantum field theory. This is broken down into four independent work packages. The first goal is to show that from a Chern-Simons type partition function one can construct a homotopy Frobenius algebra and show that this is essentially an equivalence between the relevant deformation spaces. The second goal is to algebraically construct string topology operations on the Hochschild homology of a homotopy Frobenius algebra. The third goal compares the induced structure on the cyclic homology with the known homotopy involutive Lie bialgebra structure. And ultimately, the fourth goal is to compare the algebraically constructed operations with geometric ones on the loop space under the comparison map given by Chens iterated integrals.","2022-08-24 01:44:00","228679","10.3030/896370"

It has also had in the past significant interaction with Probability starting with Constructive QFT and rigorous statistical mechanics. The goal of this proposal is to bring QFT methods to probabilistic problems and  new ideas from Probability to QFT. It concentrates on two concrete topics: (1) Renormalization Group study of rough Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, both their path wise solutions and their space-time correlations and stationary states. These equations are  ubiquitous in non-equilibrium physics and they are mathematically challenging.  (2) The use of Multiplicative Chaos theory in the rigorous construction and study of the Liouville  Conformal Field Theory. Liouville theory is one of the most studied  Conformal Field Theories in physics due to its connection to scaling limits of random surfaces and string theory. It has   many mathematically puzzling features and its rigorous study is now possible. Although the  physical applications of these theories are far apart on the level of mathematical methods they have a  common unity based on renormalization theory that I want to utilize. I think time is ripe for a new fruitful interaction between QFT and Probability.","2022-08-23 22:40:00","210052","10.3030/741487"

I will concentrate on two approaches to family formation; adoption of a child(ren) and assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) using gamete (egg and/or sperm) donation. The study will focus on Indian couples who are residents of India and exclude members of the Indian diaspora who travel to India seeking adoption and/or ARTs. The objective of the research project will be achieved through three interconnected work packages each with specific research questions and methodology. The first work package involves a systematic literature review of factors influencing uptake of adoption as a means of family formation in India and globally. The second work package comprises of a normative analysis of Indian regulatory frameworks on adoption and use of ARTs (using gamete donation) in comparison to key international and European regulations. The last work package is designed to explore values, decision making process and experience of intending Indian parents regarding their chosen means of family formation using qualitative research methods. The insights generated from this project will be relevant for evidence based regulatory approaches to ARTs and adoption not only in India and other low-resource countries but also for global regulation of cross-border reproductive care.

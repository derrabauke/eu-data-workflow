Using a new catalyst class (photodecarboxylases) we will establish a completely new method for the conversion of fatty acids into alkanes (instead of the traditionally used fatty acid methyl esters). Using a novel photoreactor design, we will overcome current limitations of photobiocatalysis (i.e. low quantum efficiency due to poor light penetration into the reactor) and demonstrate the scaleability and economic viability of our next generation of biodiesel.","2022-10-11 18:36:12","233154","10.3030/966788"

As lipofuscin cannot be removed from the RPE cells in the eyes neither spontaneously nor with existing therapies, the accumulation of lipofuscin in the RPE cells of the eyes results in the degradation of the RPE cells and consequently in worsening of visual acuity and could lead to blindness. Soraprazan was able to show removal of lipofuscin in RPE cells. Aim of the phase II trial in this project is to evaluate savety and efficacy or orally taken Soraprazan treatment compared to placebo.","2022-11-09 18:14:52","213048","10.3030/779317"

The timing of RAPID closely corresponds with a current focus of the vaccine industry on novel vaccineplatform technologies that enable rapid response to emerging threats.The BunyaVax RNA particle technology combines the efficacy of live vaccines with the safety of inactivated or subunitvaccines – which are currently the standard vaccine technologies. A unique characteristic of the RNA platform is that itallows for ‘plug and play’ application. Any gene can be plugged into the RNA particle genome to generate inherently safeand efficacious vaccines. The platform can stably express a broad variety of pathogen derived antigens. A major advantageis that development and manufacturing can be completed in a timeframe of 16 weeks which is at least twice as fast ascurrent methods. The BunyaVax technology is in a stage of proven efficacy in sheep.RAPID is designed to prepare for partnerships with vaccine manufacturers and/or venture capital firms and to lay thefoundation for clinical application of the vaccine platform. Key steps for upscaled production levels will be taken. The innovation project is at the core of the strategy of BunyaVax. The project is instrumental for reaching a stage in which commercial partnerships can be explored. Ultimately, this will allow BunyaVax to forward the technology to a stage in which industry can use it to develop vaccines for controlling veterinary and human infectious disease outbreaks at an earlier stage than currently possible.","2022-08-10 13:02:19","217731","10.3030/815645"

They are essential to understand how tissues such as intestine and liver take up and degrade pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the lack of suitable in vitro systems, these assays are carried out in experimental animals. This practice increases cost and development time but also creates significant ethical issues. We recently developed a 3D culture system that allows us to expand human tissue stem cells from intestine and liver as organoids and differentiate them to the respective functional adult tissue in vitro. These stem cell-derived tissues show high cytochrome activity and are able to metabolize drugs in a simple and cost-effective in vitro assay. With support from the ERC Proof of concept grant we aim to prove that our technology can outperform current in vitro systems and replace a significant portion of animal-based toxicology studies. This technological advance will lead to substantial reduction of cost in industrial and academic drug development and overcome practical and ethical pitfalls in animal-based testing.To this end we will develop an organoid-based assay to test tissue-drug interactions in three steps:1) Definition of optimal parameters for human in vitro assays to assess gastro-intestinal and hepatic toxicity 2) Scale-up3) Technology transfer and commercial distribution","2022-08-09 18:23:21","209165","10.3030/737600"

This data has the potential to probe deeper into the flaws of the Standard Model. However, the complexity of theoretical predictions using perturbative quantum field theory currently prevents many of these precision tests.JetDynamics aims for a breakthrough in precision predictions for the measurements of Standard Model interactions through the study of the dynamics of multiple strongly interacting hadronic jets. Percent level predictions for 2 to 3 scattering processes involving the Higgs boson and electroweak vector bosons will allow a unique insight into fundamental properties of the Standard Model in the new high energy region probed by the LHC.In order to achieve this goal a complete set of quantum corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbation theory are required.

The experimental platform is a two-dimensional crystal of laser-cooled ions held in a radio-frequency trap. In this approach, the quantum state of a spin is encoded in two electronic levels of an ion. Effective spin-spin interactions are induced by laser fields coupling the ions’ electronic levels to excitations of the crystal lattice. Single-particle quantum control will be achieved by manipulating individual ions with a strongly focused steerable laser beam. Single-shot quantum measurements with near-unit detection efficiency will enable measurements of arbitrary spin correlation functions.The main goals of SPICY are:1. Trapping and laser-cooling of two-dimensional ion crystals to millikelvin temperatures in a radio-frequency trap. 2.

One of the main goals of a HIV-1 vaccine is the generation of cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses that counteract the virus. CD8 T cells participate in the control of viremia early but progressively show weakened functions, which leads to loss of virus control. HIV controllers are a rare group of infected patients who can control the virus for years without antiretroviral therapy. CD8 T cells from HIV-controllers display an outstanding capacity to eliminate infected CD4 T cells ex vivo but the underlying mechanisms are still not understood.Preliminary data aiming at establishing a single cell transcriptional signature associated with control of HIV suggest an important role of the mTOR pathway during the chronic stage. This pathway plays a major role in glucose metabolism and CD8 T cells cytotoxic function. This raises the hypothesis that the extraordinary HIV-suppressive capacity of HIV-controllers CD8 T cells is associated with the modulation of mTOR pathway and glucose metabolism.This project aims to 1) Study the single cell gene expression of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in HIV patients longitudinally from acute to chronic stages and understand the factors linked to control and loss of function of CD8 T cells during disease progression. 2) To characterize the role of mTOR pathway in the ability of CD8 T cells from HIV-controller to eliminate infected cells and test if this pathway can be modulated to fine-tune anti-HIV CD8 T cells responses. 3) To understand if an optimal glucose metabolism is necessary for CD8 T-cells suppression of HIV and if this capacity can be improved by increasing available glucose. This work will help to understand the characteristics of effective CD8+ T cell responses against HIV and may guide the development of anti-HIV vaccines or immunotherapies to induce HIV controller-like responses in HIV-infected progressors.","2022-08-09 08:49:10","201464","10.3030/706871"

This novel and versatile methodology has been used to measure exotic nuclei down to rates of less than 20 atoms/second. In order to achieve these results the CRIS method has had to efficiently remove interference isotopes that would otherwise saturate the detectors. The key advantages of the method are its high selectivity, interference suppression and compact size. In principle it can be combined with mass spectrometry techniques such as ICP-MS and IRMS to enhance their respective sensitivity by more than three orders of magnitude in a compact table top device. This would have applications in the industries that utilize radioisotope detection for molecular labelling and dating.  We believe that our methodology has the potential to significantly reduce the costs associated detecting isotopes such as 14C. In this project we will define and develop a commercialization strategy and effective route to market as well as produce a well defined IP position. A prototype device with autosampling capabilities will be constructed and used for benchmarking and validation tests that will further inform the marketing strategy. The final deliverables of this project will be a package consisting of a working prototype that demonstrates the ability to rapidly analyse biological samples and a commercialization strategy that has a clearly defined route to market and IP position.","2022-08-09 19:37:55","211142","10.3030/768258"

FAVIT will analyse the current aerospace standards and guidelines to identify how the design and verification processes can be enhanced to accelerate the processes using the state-of-the-art technologies based in virtual testing. FAVIT Project aims to become the tool for Clean Sky 2 to obtain this complete and accurate feasibility analysis of innovative practices in virtual testing methods for aircraft certification contributing to an innovative future framework of the aerospace standards in Europe. The methodology for the development of this study will include interaction with main stakeholders from the industry and the relevant certification authorities, as well as dissemination events to promote projects results.","2022-11-25 13:33:14","225386","10.3030/864475"

For participants of Horizon 2020 Space the project will allow to continue organising information days, providing a newsletter service and a website. To improve the performance of single Space NCPs exchange means and trainings will be performed. Through this the overall performance of NCP services should be improved.","2022-11-25 11:22:55","223881","10.3030/857691"

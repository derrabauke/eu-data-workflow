The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of developing these new immunostimulators into an attractive commercial proposition. Establishment of technical feasibility will involve identification the most promising modifications of our drug candidates and testing their efficacy in disease models of cancer and immunization. In addition, we will determine commercial feasibility by conducting market research and competition analysis and by engaging potential industry partners.","2022-10-08 19:24:07","236973","10.3030/966687"

Using a new catalyst class (photodecarboxylases) we will establish a completely new method for the conversion of fatty acids into alkanes (instead of the traditionally used fatty acid methyl esters). Using a novel photoreactor design, we will overcome current limitations of photobiocatalysis (i.e. low quantum efficiency due to poor light penetration into the reactor) and demonstrate the scaleability and economic viability of our next generation of biodiesel.","2022-10-11 18:36:12","233154","10.3030/966788"

This project will pioneer the use of mainstream PlayStation VR technologies for innovative educational applications which engage world-wide audiences in the Europe’s rich historical and scientific heritage. Supported by the R&D team at Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe (SIEE), it will actively inform and map the processes and technologies required for SMEs to successfully bring new gamified VR applications to Sony’s online PlayStation Store. The resulting technology and tools will provide an infrastructure for creating educational VR experiences and generate new business opportunities outside of traditional gaming activities on the PlayStation platform. In the process it will create inclusive narrative-driven VR experiences which improve the social and physical accessibility of cultural heritage and contribute to the digital preservation of historical sites.","2022-10-08 17:59:24","206368","10.3030/732599"

Current non-invasive tests are not very precise. The malaria protein VAR2CSA has been evoluationary refined to bind specifically to human placent cells. This causes the syndrom placental malaria in pregnant women. Recombinant VAR2CSA binds with high specificity to syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta as well as placental cell lines. Using this knowledge we have developed a powerful tool which captures circulating trophoblast from a blood sample from pregnant women. This tool enables non-invasive fetal diagnostic, early in pregnancy. The aim of the ERC PoC project is to A) prepare a strategic product and business plan and B) further develop and validate the methodology enabling facile and early non-invasive fetal diagnostic.","2022-09-09 19:18:42","226567","10.3030/875297"

The second system is based on electromagnetic induction and will be tested on a wing fixed leading edge and on a flap leading edge.","2022-09-04 00:58:38","213822","10.3030/785550"

This is achieved by showing that chain-level string topological structures are induced by a homotopy Frobenius structure on the cochain algebra and by connecting the homotopy Frobenius structure with known invariants from quantum field theory. This is broken down into four independent work packages. The first goal is to show that from a Chern-Simons type partition function one can construct a homotopy Frobenius algebra and show that this is essentially an equivalence between the relevant deformation spaces. The second goal is to algebraically construct string topology operations on the Hochschild homology of a homotopy Frobenius algebra. The third goal compares the induced structure on the cyclic homology with the known homotopy involutive Lie bialgebra structure. And ultimately, the fourth goal is to compare the algebraically constructed operations with geometric ones on the loop space under the comparison map given by Chens iterated integrals.","2022-09-16 21:43:41","228679","10.3030/896370"

In addition, around 80% of drugs under research do not reach clinical trials (due to toxicity or lack of efficacy). ENZYMLOGIC was created with the aim of being a company in the niche of kinetic analysis. They have developed KINETICfinder: an experimental, robust, accurate and reproducible methodology that provides drug kinetic analyses in a massive way and at affordable cost, so it is possible to utilise it in early research stages, when thousands of drugs are involved. ENZYMLOGIC has been focused on providing auxiliar external analysis having pharmaceutical companies as customers. Nowadays, there are no comparable technologies capables of generating this amount of information with this level of processivity (number of drugs analysed at the same time). Currently, this analysis is extremely slow and costly, thus it is carried out in the final stages of the research, with just a small number of drugs. Otherwise, the number of different drugs they can analyse is 10 times higher and 10 times faster than other kinetic analysis (processivity).  KINETICfinder can reduce the time and cost by 50% from the research phase of a new drug to the market phase. KINETICfinder already makes it possible to analyse 30 kinase targets (involved in cancer), and the next step is to work with GPCRs (neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, pain, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes). 40% of the existing drugs are aimed at GPCRs. ENZYMLOGIC has obtained several prizes recognizing innovation and potential growth.

In view of ultra-large amounts of genome sequence data emerging from ever more and technologically rapidly advancing genome sequencing devices—in the meantime, amounts of sequencing data accrued are reaching into the exabyte scale—the driving, urgent question is: how can we arrange and analyze these data masses in a formally rigorous, computationally efficient and biomedically rewarding manner?Graph based data structures have been pointed out to have disruptive benefits over traditional sequence based structures when representing pan-genomes, sufficiently large, evolutionarily coherent collections of genomes. This idea has its immediate justification in the laws of genetics: evolutionarily closely related genomes vary only in relatively little amounts of letters, while sharing the majority of their sequence content. Graph-based pan-genome representations that allow to remove redundancies without having to discard individual differences, make utmost sense. In this project, we will put this shift of paradigms—from sequence to graph based representations of genomes—into full effect.

Three main reasons account for why packaging becomes obsolete. A discontinu-ation of a product & its packaging causes its packaging in-stock to be of no use. Also, legislation when changed can disqualify existing packaging rendering it unusable. In addition, Printing errors make the packaging unsuitable for use. When this happens, this obsolete packaging has to be replaced with new packaging incurring more costs through reprinting. Over 40years, ROTOPRINT has recovered 950000 km of obsolete packaging by printing over already printed packaging formats in a process called over-printing. However current high fixed costs of overprinting are threatening its viability to recycle obso-lete packaging. The Flexible packaging market, valued at €196 billion in 2017, is expected to reach a value of €248 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 3.86% validating the growing market demand for overprint-ing as larger volumes to be obsolete with increase in market size.

The microwave pre-treatment process converts hard carbon in the slurry, which cannot be digested by bacteria, into soluble carbon, thus increasing the total bio-available carbon in the slurry and improving the Carbon:Nitrogen ratio. Therefore the costs of using AD with pig slurry, are extremely high. Our innovative pre-treatment technology removes the need to add organic material and increases the biogas yield from slurry by 20%. This therefore provides farmers with a realistic solution to deal with the ever-growing amounts of slurry produced. With a payback of 4 years, our biowave system provides an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective method for pig slurry treatment that eases farmers’ legislative burdens. It helps reduce energy costs and helps to achieve the EU goal of sourcing 20% of all energy consumed from renewable energy.","2022-05-26 09:01:03","200838",""

DCs consume around 3% of today’s world global energy supply, accounting for 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions. If a DC were to suddenly stop operating, much of the computer-connected world would be affected and it could cost businesses millions of euros. In order for these DCs to operate with minimal to zero downtime sufficient power and cooling is required. In Europe, the IT sector consumed 8-10% of all generated electricity, and all DCs combined were responsible for 2% of all energy consumption. More than 50% of this energy is used to cool the IT system (approx. 50% of the ongoing running costs) and as much as 80% of this energy is wasted as heat. Reducing the power consumption and improving efficiency of DCs to ultimately reduce operating costs and support the industry growth has become a major challenge with many efforts from governments and companies around the world. With an increasing number of high power density DCs being built, traditional air-cooling systems (most popular cooling for DCs) are unable to properly cool high-power density IT environments. Instead, liquid-cooling technologies on the market can support higher power densities, but do not provide high-availability, lack flexibility, are messy to handle and energy is still wasted, which is why this technology hasn’t yet become the norm in DCs. Asperitas, our start-up, has developed AIC24; a modular liquid cooling system that can meet the needs of high power density environments in availability and ease of use while reducing energy use by 50%, total cost of ownership by 35%, CapEx by 25%, and ensuring energy is recycled. In 5 years from completion of the project, we expect to gain €26,2 million in cumulative profits, hire 38 new employees and achieve a ROI of €6,48 per euro invested in this project.","2022-05-26 00:13:05","216799",""

To solve this problem, we developed LUBRIGONE, a new line of PFS stoppers combining a chemically inert Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE) and unique sealing profile designs, which eliminates the need for lubrication and/or coating of the stopper and container. In this way, LUBRIGONE enables a completely clean injection system, protecting sensitive injectables from pollution, and protecting users against potential damage, while granting an optimal functionality (maintaining an acceptable break loose force and mean forces in PFS). Our company, Injecto A/S was founded in 2014 with the goal to develop safe medical devices with primary focus on safe PFS syringes and their stoppers, to create safe and long-term stable drug injections. As a result, the LUBRIGONE project, will be a cornerstone for us, as it will enable us to exploit the market opportunity derived from its competitive advantages over current silicone-oil coated rubber stoppers, and the lack of feasible cost-effective alternatives, In this way, it will facilitate our growth and international expansion: our forecasts are to sell 21.4 million units in the first 4 years of commercialization, resulting in €10.7 million accumulated revenues by 2024, and increasing our staff by 250%","2020-03-25 12:42:29","224460",""

Recent evidence shows that resident macrophages can originate from embryonicprogenitors and be maintained in tissues long term by local proliferation independently of monocytes. This self-renewalability, however, appears to decline with age, with potentially major consequences for the response to infection, theresolution of inflammation and the ability for tissue regeneration. Understanding the decline of self-renewal in the agingmacrophage may thus hold key elements for maintaining healthy tissue integrity. Drawing from analogies to stem cell self-renewal we want to decipher the molecular and cellular parameters of macrophage self-renewal and its decline with age.We want to understand the age-associated changes in gene expression and epigenetic identity of tissue macrophagepopulations with the ultimate goal to reverse age dependent decline in self-renewal and function. Results from mylaboratory have identified transcription factors that control the access to a network of self-renewal genes that are also used in stem cells. Using several complementary genetic mouse models tapping into this network we want to investigate whether its activation in resident macrophage population in vivo can rejuvenate their self-renewal capacity and revert aging related changes. These approaches will be complemented by unbiased genome wide screens in vivo using latest generation CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to identify new signaling pathways guiding macrophage self-renewal and aging. Using innovate combinations of genetics and adoptive transfer protocols we will test whether this knowledge can be employed to reverse macrophage dependent loss of immune competence and failed tissue regeneration with age. Our results will lead to new general insight and potential novel cellular therapies for degenerative diseases.","2022-02-10 17:30:31","205722",""

Across the social sciences and as well as journalistic literatures, there has been a remarkable proliferation of debates around the social and ecological implications of contemporary urbanization.        What is largely missing in these timely debates, however, is any systematic and in-depth engagement with the political significance of the ongoing ‘urban revolution.’ This is due to a lack of systematic research and theoretical engagement regarding the unprecedented prominence of accumulation regimes based on the speculative production, trade and consumption of space. Similarly, extant theoretical tools of urban political analysis fall short of conceptualizing the increasingly planetary nature of privatization and exploitation of the urban and their intricate links to global finance. In addressing these gaps the project advances two overarching goals: 1. to develop conceptual tools for and comparative insights into the increasingly dominant urban-based accumulation regimes, and 2. to advance the politicization of academic and public discourses on the planetary urban condition.    I propose three relational levels (extended moments) of analysis, which respectively focus on the finance/real-estate/state nexus, the exploitation of the urban, and the emerging spaces of the political. These correspond to three subprojects that focus on transnational, everyday, and political dimensions of the urban revolution. The methodological approach will be multi-sited global ethnography, which will combine ethnographies of place-based relations and transnational networks.

As recognised by the European Commission, island energy is expensive, polluting, inefficient and dependent on external supply, with significant negative impacts on emissions, the competitiveness of businesses, and the economy. Assuming that just 65% of these islands’ electricity comes from diesel, we estimate that they produce approximately 17.5 million tonnes of CO2 every year. This is further increased when considering isolated coastal communities. Existing renewable alternatives are often unsuitable for these communities, such as wind and solar power, as the energy they generate is unpredictable and intermittent, making it difficult to rely on. They also have a large land footprint and high CAPEX costs. Tidal energy is also often unsuitable, as it requires fast tidal flows (over 2.5m/s) which only occur in a few specific hot spots around the World. The technology is also expensive, with both high CAPEX and OPEX costs. The Deep Green Island Mode (DG Island Mode) is a stand-alone tidal and ocean current energy converter for off-grid applications. The DG Island Mode is the concept of flying an underwater kite, that when steered in an 8-shaped trajectory, generates a speed of 8-10 times the speed of the actual current. This generates the following unique performance characteristics: - Generates cost effective electricity in tidal flows as low as 1.3 m/s - Generates up to 100kW, producing an estimated 0.35 GWh/year, enough to power 100 homes; - Can be located close to the shore; - Up to 15 times lighter per kW compared to other tidal energy solutions - Easy, low cost installation and maintenance (low CAPEX and OPEX costs); - Cost of energy 50% lower than diesel generators DG Island Mode offers cheap, clean, reliable electricity generation to island communities.","2018-10-03 13:03:20","217079",""

According to Block (1996),visual consciousness, rather than being unitary, is an hybrid theoretical construct that includes at least two discernible concepts: Phenomenal or P-consciousness, which represents the experiential properties of our perceptions, and Access or A-consciousness, which refers to the availability of part of the visual information for use in reasoning and rationally driven action.Intriguingly, according to Lamme (2003), the two types of consciousness can be linked to different stages of visual information processing. Specifically, P-consciousness is related to the iconic memory content of the original visual experience, while A-consciousness is associated with the working memory content of a “survived” piece of the original experience, after different processing stages. The route from P- to A- consciousness (PtoACons) involves several cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, decision-making and metacognition, which are intermingled and spatiotemporally overlaped. This route emerges from the activity of multiple neurons interconnected by local visual and global fronto-parietal brain networks. Despite that in the last years has been done a significant progress on the knowledge of the brain circuits of visual consciousness, its precise functional organization and neural dynamics are still largely unknown.The present project aims to scan the spatiotemporal evolution of visual consciousness, by combining psychophysical measures, MEG recordings and patients’ studies.

CDI poses an extensive burden of morbidity, mortality andhealthcare resource utilization, and so requires effective prevention and management strategies.Epidemiological data are, however, limited and studies typically have examined only part of ahealthcare economy and usually have been focused on single countries/healthcare systems. Thus,there is a lack of robust, comprehensive data on the impact of CDI across countries in Europe.Furthermore, we know that large variations in the frequency of testing and the sensitivity of CDIdiagnostics across European countries mean that the size of the problem is underestimated.Combating Bacterial Resistance in Europe-CDI (COMBACTE-CDI) therefore aims todevelop a detailed understanding of the epidemiology and clinical impact of CDI across multipleEuropean countries. Our project proposal provides a collaborative approach comprising threescientific work packages (WPs). A large epidemiology study will be undertaken across Europe inWP1 to quantify the burden of CDI (incidence, distribution, recurrence, morbidity, mortality,transmission) across the whole healthcare economy. This will be followed by a case/control study inWP2, which along with data collected in a questionnaire will enable the consortium to assesscurrent practices in Europe (guidelines, testing, surveillance, treatment, cost) and their potentialimpacts. WP3 will create a rich, European, research platform that will provide support for futureproof-of-concept and clinical studies of new prevention and treatment strategies for CDI. The threeinterrelated research WPs will be supported by a management work package (WP4).COMBACTE-CDI will harmonise with many of the IMI2 objectives; specifically, we aim toimprove the health of European citizens by providing evidence of the true epidemiology andtransmission of CDI. We will also develop ‘best-practice’ models for diagnosis, treatment andsurveillance, which should reduce the incidence and impact of CDI (including mortality) acrossEurope, and will optimize patient management. Notably, in order to deliver these aims costeffectivelyand to test the resilience of our data, we will actively link and compare our data withother European projects that include CDI as a target condition. This synergistic approach will be allthe more feasible as the participants in COMBACTE-CDI are playing key roles in multiple,relevant, parallel European CDI activities.Our ambitious proposal aims to go beyond the state of the art in 8 aspects: quantification ofCDI in the whole healthcare economy; contemporaneous comparison with animal and food isolateswith those within human health; identification of potential drivers of strain clustering, providingenhanced information to aid further trial/study design and conduct; use of a novel highly sensitivediagnostic assay for more accurate CDI case definition; provision of both cost-effectiveness andtransmission models to enable further evaluation of interventions; and finally, by comparing overallcosts in different European healthcare settings, we will, for the first time, allow simulation of theeconomic impact of novel CDI treatment options, even prior to market authorization.COMBACTE-CDI is the merger of excellent European expertise on the clinical, diagnostic,and therapeutic issues related to CDI and the expertise and input of 7 EFPIA partners.

In EU and the US antibiotic resistance infections have been estimated to cause > 48 000 deaths from 2,5 million resistant infections and confer an excess direct healthcare cost of € 20 billion annually. A major contributor to this is current diagnostic methods, being slow (longer than 48 hours), resource-consuming and/or non comprehensive resulting in ineffective treatment. 1928 Diagnostics is developing a software solution that takes advantage of modern DNA technology (next generation sequencing, NGS) that is currently not used in clinical routine due to complex data analysis that is time and recourse intensive. Our solution is a software-as-a-service that combines cloud computing and a proprietary bioinformatics platform that automatically processes large and complex data to give resistance profiles as well as bacterial identification in just 15 minutes, enabling complete diagnosis in under 12 hours. The only thing required at the hospital laboratory is an internet connection in order to upload NGS raw data and to download the resistance profiles that will be used as a decision support for the doctor in the treatment selection for a particular patient. The result is shortened time from patient sampling to treatment, resulting in reduced mortality, less transmission of resistant bacteria and diminished costs for the health care system and society.Our product addresses a market that is worth over € 8 BN based on 55 million potential tests in EU and US.The feasibility study will focus on understanding the customers and market demands for the first version of the product in order to reach the market in the most efficient way.

Excessive bleeding contributes to longer hospital stays and delayed post-operative recovery. This incurs costs for both hospitals and patients with increased operating room time estimated to cost €1,542 - €2,554/hour while increased hospital stay is estimated at €1,038/day. Conventional techniques used to control excessive bleeding such as electrocautery are not always feasible and are often restricted to accessible vessels of a minimum size. This limits their applicability and contributes to postoperative drainage and pain. Haemostatic agents are formulations designed to arrest bleeding by supplementing the normal haemostatic mechanism of the body. Most haemostats currently used by surgeons to control bleeding have lengthy preparation times, are difficult to apply and stick to surgical instruments which limits their suitable application. In response, Biom’up has developed HEMOSNOW, a unique haemostatic powder formulation capable of stopping level 1 & 2 bleeding on the SPOTGRADE scale (developed and patented by Biom’up to quantitatively determine bleeding from surgical wounds). This collagen-based powder is ready to use and stops bleeding within 6minutes. It will equip surgeons with an effective tool for rapid and effective haemostasis, reduce operational procedure time and reduce the risk of surgical errors which occur when the surgeon’s vision is obscured by excessive blood. Patients benefit through lower healthcare costs, faster recovery and lower risks associated with blood transfusion.

However, effective treatments are missing and research and health care reinforce an inefficient and burdensome single-disease framework.The solution:Exercise has the potential to disrupt the ‘vicious cycle’ of systemic inflammation associated with chronic conditions and improve health in multimorbidity. A personalized exercise and education program aimed at supporting subsequent self-management by the individual will be developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration, building on evidence from biomarkers, patient involvement and methodological expertise.

Most plastic bottles are made from PET (oil-based polyethylene terephthalate) but PEF is a superior polymer. It offers a better barrier for CO2 and O2, is stronger but thinner and has a longer shelf life. PEF is a bio-based substitute for oil-based PET. However, in the market, there is not an industrial commercial process to produce FDCA because of the price. After a long R&D way, we offers an HMF from biomass, which a price more than 2000% lower than currently. Diverse approaches for the oxidation of HMF to FDCA have been developed usually with uncompleted conversion. However, we have developed a continuous, integrated pilot plant for the oxidation of HMF in water with paired electrochemical oxidation to obtain FDCA and its purification. This technology has advantages since the oxidant is substituted by electrons, and the oxidation occurs at both anode and cathode, thus the produced waste and energy are minimized. Applying this concept we obtain FDCA with yields >99% in the lab and a purity of 99.95 wt%. The selectivity is >90% without any dangerous by-products. The process also takes place in water so neither hazardous organic solvents are necessary. It is considered as a green process because an energy savings of 66% and GHG emissions reductions by 35% are realized. Thus, the bio-based FDCA end-product will be offered to the market at much lower price than currently, having a crucial role to play in the PEF bioplastic packaging.","2018-10-31 16:26:05","217556",""

HNC imposes an extremely high socioeconomic burden on patients during and after cancer compared to other tumors, including costs from treatment-induced morbidities, loss of workforce participation and short-term disability. Current survivorship care plans mostly focus on functional and health conditions of treated patients, whereas socioeconomic determinants of quality of life are often neglected due to difficult data collection.The widespread technologies for social communication and unobtrusive personal monitoring embedded in smartphones and object we commonly use and in our living environments  have the potential to unobtrusively collect wealth of indicators of individual QoL.

The conservative estimates state that wind could provide us with 1,800 TW of energy—100X more than the current global demand for power. But most of this wind is at high altitudes, and is available almost anywhere on the planet 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The conventional wind turbines, although having improved immensely over the past decade, have hit a technological plateau: they cannot be made much taller to reach the strong, fast winds that blow at altitudes of 400+ meters.To address this challenge, we developed Skypull—a system made of an autonomous flying device (drone) connected by a tether to a ground power generator—which generates low cost electricity from abundant high altitude winds. Uniquely among the competition, we created and patented the highly efficient design of the flying device. We foresee incremental development over several variants to reach a 1 MW Skypull SP3 system by 2021, capable of generating electricity at €40-50/MWh. With that device in place we will grow the revenues from €2m in 2020 (3 units sold in Switzerland) to €140.3m in 2030 (200 units sold globally), with an IRR of 24%+.We will work closely with the Swiss energy utility AEM SA, that abandoned its plans on implementation of wind turbines and decided to explore the potential of Skypull. We have also built a broad partner network to build Skypull.The purpose of this Phase 1 project is to carry out the market and commercial feasibility for a reduced Skypull SP2 10-100 KW demonstrator, so that it could be sold in the off-grid contexts, generating first cash flows for the company to co-finance further development of a 1 MW variant.","2019-07-15 18:48:33","213639",""

The early implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction strategies strongly depends on the availability of reliable seasonal forecasts. But global, long-term climate forecasting models are used for seasonal prediction and they are very inaccurate as they have not been designed to this end. On the other hand, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources is a challenge to grid operators, utilities and plant managers as they attempt to anticipate energy output. Reliable weather forecasts enabling an accurate prediction of energy generation in order to balance production and demand is key to boost the production of renewables and their smooth integration into the grid. Current weather forecasts used by this industry do not focus in predicting relevant variables for the energy sector (such as solar radiation).

The milkGUARD solution combines state-of-the-art methods for fastkilling of pathogens in natural milk. In a three-stage continuous process it disinfects milk with an efficacy of 99.99% - 100%.By providing a system that avoids indirect heating elements and works in continuous, we expect to reduce the operatingcosts to dairy farmers when treating milk for calf-feeding, offering e.g. 30% of energy savings when compared toconventional on-farm pasteurizers.The market: Milk is the EUs main agricultural product in terms of value – approx. 15% of agricultural output – with 160million tonnes of cow’s milk produced in 2014. The EU milk processing industry is a pillar of the European economy, whichcontributes positively to the EU trade balance, bringing over €10 billion surplus. The implementation of the innovation projectwill place Calvex in a strong position to exploit a market potential over five years exceeding €56 million.","2019-06-24 03:09:28","210857",""

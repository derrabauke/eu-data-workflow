The skills of the candidate will be critical in reaching the goals of inspection rate and of adaptability of the instrument to tailored specifications required for a successful introduction to the market. The  kills of the candidate will complement the optical and mechanical engineering skills set existing within TSD, giving the candidate great opportunities of personal development into high end metrology instrument development.","2023-10-03 19:55:24","208509","10.3030/739648"

The project builds on the concept demonstrated to the EVA project considering the suitability of ground monitoring from aerodromes with basic ATS or ground services and testing the viability for the use of PBN procedures more tailoured to the capabilities of GA and the limitations of operations in dense airspace.","2023-10-03 21:30:53","213197","10.3030/783228"

It has also had in the past significant interaction with Probability starting with Constructive QFT and rigorous statistical mechanics. The goal of this proposal is to bring QFT methods to probabilistic problems and  new ideas from Probability to QFT. It concentrates on two concrete topics: (1) Renormalization Group study of rough Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, both their path wise solutions and their space-time correlations and stationary states. These equations are  ubiquitous in non-equilibrium physics and they are mathematically challenging.  (2) The use of Multiplicative Chaos theory in the rigorous construction and study of the Liouville  Conformal Field Theory. Liouville theory is one of the most studied  Conformal Field Theories in physics due to its connection to scaling limits of random surfaces and string theory. It has   many mathematically puzzling features and its rigorous study is now possible. Although the  physical applications of these theories are far apart on the level of mathematical methods they have a  common unity based on renormalization theory that I want to utilize. I think time is ripe for a new fruitful interaction between QFT and Probability.","2023-05-04 12:54:54","210052","10.3030/741487"

This is achieved by showing that chain-level string topological structures are induced by a homotopy Frobenius structure on the cochain algebra and by connecting the homotopy Frobenius structure with known invariants from quantum field theory. This is broken down into four independent work packages. The first goal is to show that from a Chern-Simons type partition function one can construct a homotopy Frobenius algebra and show that this is essentially an equivalence between the relevant deformation spaces. The second goal is to algebraically construct string topology operations on the Hochschild homology of a homotopy Frobenius algebra. The third goal compares the induced structure on the cyclic homology with the known homotopy involutive Lie bialgebra structure. And ultimately, the fourth goal is to compare the algebraically constructed operations with geometric ones on the loop space under the comparison map given by Chens iterated integrals.","2023-07-01 15:46:39","228679","10.3030/896370"

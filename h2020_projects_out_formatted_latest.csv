Within this project novel photopharmacological targets will be evaluated and investigated. Additionally, in vivo proof of concept will be generated to make our technology ready for further clinical validation.","2022-11-09 19:38:41","226568","10.3030/875163"

As lipofuscin cannot be removed from the RPE cells in the eyes neither spontaneously nor with existing therapies, the accumulation of lipofuscin in the RPE cells of the eyes results in the degradation of the RPE cells and consequently in worsening of visual acuity and could lead to blindness. Soraprazan was able to show removal of lipofuscin in RPE cells. Aim of the phase II trial in this project is to evaluate savety and efficacy or orally taken Soraprazan treatment compared to placebo.","2022-11-09 18:14:52","213048","10.3030/779317"

FAVIT will analyse the current aerospace standards and guidelines to identify how the design and verification processes can be enhanced to accelerate the processes using the state-of-the-art technologies based in virtual testing. FAVIT Project aims to become the tool for Clean Sky 2 to obtain this complete and accurate feasibility analysis of innovative practices in virtual testing methods for aircraft certification contributing to an innovative future framework of the aerospace standards in Europe. The methodology for the development of this study will include interaction with main stakeholders from the industry and the relevant certification authorities, as well as dissemination events to promote projects results.","2022-11-25 13:33:14","225386","10.3030/864475"

For participants of Horizon 2020 Space the project will allow to continue organising information days, providing a newsletter service and a website. To improve the performance of single Space NCPs exchange means and trainings will be performed. Through this the overall performance of NCP services should be improved.","2022-11-25 11:22:55","223881","10.3030/857691"

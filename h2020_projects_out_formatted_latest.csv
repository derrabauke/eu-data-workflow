The idea is to split the information of an optical signal using an “acousto-optic modulator” (synapse) into multiple signals. The signals are then communicated through multiple parallel channels similar to neurons and recombined at the receiver end by using another acousto-optic modulator. Such neuro-synaptic networks are targeted for less than 100 mW power budget and greater than 100 GHz communication bandwidths which are currently hindered by the performance of the piezoelectric transducer used in the acousto-optic modulators. It generates high-frequency acoustic waves inside the attached waveguide which act as dynamic optical gratings offering periodic modification of the refractive index of the medium through which the light is traveling. To solve this issue, the applicant proposes exploring optically birefringent ferroelectrics with strong elasto-optic coefficients as stand-alone acousto-optic modulators. The project aims for the development of a CMOS compatible 100 GHz-THz range ferroelectric acousto-optic modulator (FAOM) and its integration in a self-learning neuro-synaptic network. The applicant will unite his expertise in materials engineering and photo-ferroelectrics with Katholieke Universiteit Leuven’s (KUL) and IBM’s knowledge of the integration and characterization of neuromorphic networks with the following objectives: 1. Growth of CMOS compatible strain-engineered BaTiO3 (BTO) heterostructures.2.

Important problems to be solved on the way to the applications of SMMs in molecular spintronics is their deposition on surfaces and addressing their spins on the single molecular level. In this project we will address these problems by designing SMMs based on endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) derivatized with anchoring groups. SMM behaviour recently discovered for DySc2N@C80 and Dy2ScN@C80 in PI’s group is governed by a strong magnetic anisotropy (magnetic moments of Dy ions are aligned along the Dy–N bonds) and ferromagnetic exchange interactions between Dy ions within the clusters. Protected by the carbon cages, these SMMs exhibit uniquely long zero-field relaxation times of several hours at 2 K and provide an ideal system for addressing the individual spin states. Spatial orientation of magnetic moments in EMF-SMMs is determined by the endohedral cluster and is therefore influenced by the orientation of the EMFs molecules and their internal dynamics. We will apply three strategies to control the spatial arrangement of the magnetic moments in EMF-SMMs: (i) deposition of EMF molecules via sublimation; (ii) exohedral modification of EMFs with anchoring groups for grafting of EMFs on surfaces; (iii) introducing photoswitchable units into the anchoring groups which can reversibly change their geometry upon impact of light and will allow switching direction of the magnetic moment in a fully controllable way. Magnetic behaviour of the surface-grafted SMMs will be studied by bulk- and surface-sensitive techniques including X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and especially spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Successful fulfillment of the objectives of this interdisciplinary high-risk/high-gain project will revolutionize the field of the surface molecular magnetism by allowing the study and control of the SMMs on a single spin level.","2022-08-18 08:50:13","194532","10.3030/648295"

The experimental platform is a two-dimensional crystal of laser-cooled ions held in a radio-frequency trap. In this approach, the quantum state of a spin is encoded in two electronic levels of an ion. Effective spin-spin interactions are induced by laser fields coupling the ions’ electronic levels to excitations of the crystal lattice. Single-particle quantum control will be achieved by manipulating individual ions with a strongly focused steerable laser beam. Single-shot quantum measurements with near-unit detection efficiency will enable measurements of arbitrary spin correlation functions.The main goals of SPICY are:1. Trapping and laser-cooling of two-dimensional ion crystals to millikelvin temperatures in a radio-frequency trap. 2. Realization of quantum spin models with particle numbers for which the simulation becomes intractable by numerical techniques.3. Development of methods for validating quantum simulators 4. Investigation of various models with spin-frustration in two-dimensional geometries.SPICY builds on my experience with small-scale one-dimensional trapped-ion simulators. The exploration of two-dimensional lattice geometries will overcome difficulties in scaling up one-dimensional trapped-ion systems and enable the experimental investigation of the rich physics of two-dimensional spin models.","2022-08-25 15:38:21","211344","10.3030/741541"

It is designed to secure the involvement of additional end-users to perform operational demonstrations to confirm the benefits and increase awareness ofpromising solutions targeting specific operational scenarios and environments.AUDIO is addressing the topic Integrated Airport Operations (SESAR-VLD1-02-2016) which is related to the Very Large Demonstration PJ28 IA (Integrated Airport Operations as part of SESAR2020). In particular AUDIO demonstrates the use of functionalities designed to improve airport operations from an airspace user perspective.For the On-board taxi functions, on-board surface guidance will be demonstrated on board of aircraft during day to day operations of airlines. Demonstrations will be conducted in a real live environment.A dedicated dissemination WP is designed to cover the important need of the distribution of results. Coordinated with the dissemination activities of PJ28 a harmonized approach will be taken to make sure the results of the demonstration activities are well communicated within the SESAR as well as the whole ATM community.","2022-08-25 16:56:11","222513","10.3030/783161"

Up to date a commercial simulation tool including such features for the study of ice-ship interaction situations is simply not available. The ICEBREAKER PoC will help move the SAFECON software technology towards the initial steps of an innovation process leading to a new simulation software for helping naval architects to improve the design of vessels that should be operating efficiently and safely in iced seas.The activities in the ICEBREAKER PoC will include: a) Benchmarking the SAFECON software technology for simulating the navigation of a ship in an iced-sea. b) Establishing the technical viability of application of the software by public and private organizations and companies specialized in ship design, as well as in shipyards and the maritime transport industry. c) Study the possible implementation of the software in existing commercial ship hydrodynamics analysis codes. d) Perform market research for quantifying the potential for the commercial exploitation of the SAFECON software for ice-ship interaction problems.  e) Dissemination plan for the software. f) Definition of IPR position. g) Study different exploitation models for the application of the SAFECON software technology for the enhanced design of ships cruising in iced-seas.","2022-08-17 10:02:17","205796","10.3030/737424"

This is achieved by showing that chain-level string topological structures are induced by a homotopy Frobenius structure on the cochain algebra and by connecting the homotopy Frobenius structure with known invariants from quantum field theory. This is broken down into four independent work packages. The first goal is to show that from a Chern-Simons type partition function one can construct a homotopy Frobenius algebra and show that this is essentially an equivalence between the relevant deformation spaces. The second goal is to algebraically construct string topology operations on the Hochschild homology of a homotopy Frobenius algebra. The third goal compares the induced structure on the cyclic homology with the known homotopy involutive Lie bialgebra structure. And ultimately, the fourth goal is to compare the algebraically constructed operations with geometric ones on the loop space under the comparison map given by Chens iterated integrals.","2022-09-16 21:43:41","228679","10.3030/896370"

Current non-invasive tests are not very precise. The malaria protein VAR2CSA has been evoluationary refined to bind specifically to human placent cells. This causes the syndrom placental malaria in pregnant women. Recombinant VAR2CSA binds with high specificity to syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta as well as placental cell lines. Using this knowledge we have developed a powerful tool which captures circulating trophoblast from a blood sample from pregnant women. This tool enables non-invasive fetal diagnostic, early in pregnancy. The aim of the ERC PoC project is to A) prepare a strategic product and business plan and B) further develop and validate the methodology enabling facile and early non-invasive fetal diagnostic.","2022-09-09 19:18:42","226567","10.3030/875297"

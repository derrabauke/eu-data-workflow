The goal of this proposal is to bring QFT methods to probabilistic problems and  new ideas from Probability to QFT. It concentrates on two concrete topics: (1) Renormalization Group study of rough Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, both their path wise solutions and their space-time correlations and stationary states. These equations are  ubiquitous in non-equilibrium physics and they are mathematically challenging.  (2) The use of Multiplicative Chaos theory in the rigorous construction and study of the Liouville  Conformal Field Theory. Liouville theory is one of the most studied  Conformal Field Theories in physics due to its connection to scaling limits of random surfaces and string theory. It has   many mathematically puzzling features and its rigorous study is now possible. Although the  physical applications of these theories are far apart on the level of mathematical methods they have a  common unity based on renormalization theory that I want to utilize.

The experimental platform is a two-dimensional crystal of laser-cooled ions held in a radio-frequency trap. In this approach, the quantum state of a spin is encoded in two electronic levels of an ion. Effective spin-spin interactions are induced by laser fields coupling the ions’ electronic levels to excitations of the crystal lattice. Single-particle quantum control will be achieved by manipulating individual ions with a strongly focused steerable laser beam. Single-shot quantum measurements with near-unit detection efficiency will enable measurements of arbitrary spin correlation functions.The main goals of SPICY are:1. Trapping and laser-cooling of two-dimensional ion crystals to millikelvin temperatures in a radio-frequency trap. 2.

This lead to a minimal therapeutic drug monitoring in patients and hence that 30-60% of drugs are administered without clinical benefits.  We propose to develop a point-of-care device for quantification of chemotherapeutic drugs in small body fluid samples by highly selective nanoparticle extraction and liquid crystal detection incorporated in microfluidic lab-on-chip device (optofluidics based) allowing the real-time drug monitoring. This will improve the therapeutic outcome and reduced health care costs.","2022-08-22 20:22:27","193248","10.3030/633635"
